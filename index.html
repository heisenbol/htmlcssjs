		<h1>Some heading</h1>
		
		<p>One morning, when <a href="http://www.tuc.gr">Gregor Samsa</a> woke from troubled dreams, 
		he found himself transformed in his bed into a <a href="http://www.tuc.gr/" target="_blank">horrible vermin</a>.</p>
		
		<h1>Some other heading</h1>
		<p>He lay on his armour-like back, <a href="http://www.xxxx.gr">and if he lifted his head</a> a 
		little <span>he could see his</span> brown belly, <span>slightly domed and</span> divided by 
		arches into stiff sections.</p>

		<p>The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to 
		slide off any moment.</p>

		<h1>Some 3rd heading with <br> a line break </h1>
		<h2 id="someid">and subheadings</h2>
		<h2>and more subheadings</h2>
		<h3 class="someclass">and subheadings</h3>
		<p>His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, 
		waved about helplessly as he looked.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>"What's happened to me? " he thought. It wasn't a dream.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully 
		between its four familiar walls.</p>
		
		<div class="somedivclass">
			<h3>And a list</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>We had first met when she was a child</li>
				<li>Our eyes encountered</li>
				<li>She looked at me for a moment with quiet attention</li>
				<li>Even, I had romantically imagined, with obscure, deep-lying recognition
					<ul>
						<li>I, at any rate, recognized in that look</li>
						<li>So I persuaded myself in my fever of adolescence</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>My destiny</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<p>A <strong>collection</strong> of textile <em>samples</em> lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling 
		salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an 
		illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame.</p>

		<p>It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising 
		a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.</p>
